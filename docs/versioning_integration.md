Versioning is an optional feature, so core CMS and 3rd-party apps
should be still usable when versioning is not enabled.

# Integrating Versioning

Let's use an example. There's an existing `blog` application
that has a single model called `Post`:

```python
# blog/models.py
from django.db import models


class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    text = models.TextField()
```

Versioning works by creating multiple objects (called **content objects**).
To know what these objects are versions of, there's a concept of **grouper objects**,
which tie select content objects together.

In order to make `blog` app work with versioning, changes to model structure are needed.

```python
# blog/models.py
from django.db import models


class Post(models.Model):
    pass


class PostContent(models.Model):
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    text = models.TextField()
```

This structure is not only compatible with versioning,
but also works when versioning is not enabled.

Note: With versioning disabled **grouper** essentially becomes a one-to-one
relation to **content**, as it will always be created along with
every new **content** object.

`Post` becomes a **grouper** model and `PostContent` becomes a **content** model.

Keep in mind that it's not necessary to rename `Post` to `PostContent`,
it's just a naming convention. It's absolutely possible to keep **content** model
named `Post` and have `PostGrouper` as a name of **grouper** model.

Versioning needs to be aware of these models. This can be done in `cms_config.py` file:

```python
# blog/cms_config.py
from collections import OrderedDict
from cms.app_base import CMSAppConfig
from djangocms_versioning.datastructures import VersionableItem, default_copy
from .models import PostContent

def get_preview_url(obj):
    # generate url as required
    return obj.get_absolute_url()


def stories_about_intelligent_cats(request, version, *args, **kwargs):
    return version.content.cat_stories


class BlogCMSConfig(CMSAppConfig):
    djangocms_versioning_enabled = True  # -- 1
    versioning = [
        VersionableItem(   # -- 2
            content_model=PostContent,
            grouper_field_name='post',
            copy_function=default_copy,
            preview_url=get_preview_url
        ),
    ]
    versioning_add_to_confirmation_context = {
        'unpublish': OrderedDict([('cat_stories', stories_about_intelligent_cats)]),
    }
```

1. This must be set to True for Versioning to read app's CMS config.
2. `versioning` attribute takes a list of `VersionableItem` objects.

    `VersionableItem` has the following attributes:

    - content_model - *content model* class - in our example it's `PostContent`
    - grouper_field_name - name of the field on the content model which is
    a relation to *grouper model* - in the example it's `post`
    - copy_function - a function that copies a content instance. This is
    used for some operations in versioning such as creating new drafts
    from published versions. See the copy function section of this doc for more info.
    - preview_url - This is optional attribute can be pass to override preview url for an object in version list
    table. If it is not passed then if model is a editable, it will render object preview url else
    changelist url.
3. The `versioning_add_to_confirmation_context` is a dict where the keys are
   names of actions in versioning which have confirmation pages (in the
   above example the key is `unpublish`) and the values are OrderedDict objects made up
   of keys that give a way to access the context var from the template (
   in the above example you can access the var by using `{{ extra_context.cat_stories }}`
   in the `unpublish_confirmation.html` template - by default the template will
   display context vars in the order of the OrderedDict) and functions (in
   the above example `stories_about_intelligent_cats`).
   The functions should take two params - request (a django http request object)
   and version (an instance of the Version model). However, more params
   could be added in the future, so it is recommended to make the function
   take `*args` and `**kwargs` for future compatibility.
   Versioning will run each defined function and put the result
   into the context of the relevant confirmation view.
   At this time the only dict key that is supported is `unpublish`.
   Support for adding to other confirmation views may be added in the future.


## The copy function
When configuring versioning we require you to provide a copy function.
We provide a default function for this (djangocms_versioning.datastructures.default_copy),
but there are many cases in which you may need to implement your own, these are:

    - If your content model contains any one2one or m2m fields.
    - If your content model contains a foreign key that relates to an
    object that should be considered part of the version. For example
    if you're versioning a poll object, you might consider the answers
    in the poll as part of a version. If so, you will need to copy
    the answer objects, not just the poll object. On the other hand if
    a poll has an fk to a category model, you probably wouldn't consider
    category as part of the version. In this case the default copy function
    will take care of this.
    - If other models have reverse relationships to your content model.
    - If your content model contains a generic foreign key.


# Overriding how versioning handles core cms models
By default versioning assumes that the VERSIONING_CMS_MODELS_ENABLED setting
is set to True. If you set this to False it will not register any models
from django-cms for versioning. If you set this to False you are free to
register these models again yourself with different options.
See djangocms_versioning.cms_config.VersioningCMSConfig for reference.
